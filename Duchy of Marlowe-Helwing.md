#### **Overview**

The **Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing** is a major eastern border realm, occupying fertile lowlands, river corridors, and the marsh-bound frontier known as the Fenward Marches. Historically a buffer state between the inner duchies and the eastern wilds, Marlowe-Helwing has long balanced decentralised local governance with ducal authority exercised from its ancestral seat.

In recent years, this balance has fractured. Multiple neighbouring regions have fallen to the advancing **[[Iron Host]]**, sending tens of thousands of refugees westward into the duchy. At the same time, [[Duke Helwing]]’s prolonged illness has left central authority paralysed, accelerating the rise of town councils, emergency powers, and regional strongmen.

#### **Capital and Seat of Power**

##### **On the Distinction Between Capital and Ducal Seat**

Although often referred to as a single “capital” in casual speech, Marlowe-Helwing maintains a long-standing division between **legal authority** and **practical governance**.

- **[[Helwing Hold]]** is the _ducal seat_: the site of the Duke’s court, high law, and the duchy’s archives.

- **[[Highford]]** is the _principal settlement_: the largest city and the economic, logistical, and political heart of the duchy.

This distinction has existed for generations, but has become critically important following the Duke’s incapacitation. Authority still formally emanates from [[Helwing Hold]], yet most decisions that affect daily life are now made—or enforced—in [[Highford]].

#### **Geography**

The duchy spans three broad zones:

- **The Fenward Marches** – eastern marshlands, peat flats, and deep coal seams
- **The Helwing Lowlands** – arable farmland, manors, and market towns
- **The Western Ridges** – higher ground, old stone roads, and fortified crossings

River travel dominates trade and communication, binding the duchy together even as political unity weakens.

#### **Major Settlements**

##### **[[Highford]]**

**Principal Settlement of the Duchy**

- **Population:** ~14,000
- **Geographical Position:** Central-western Marlowe-Helwing, spanning the primary stone bridge over the Highwater River
- **Role:** Trade hub, river crossing, customs and grain market
- **Notes:** [[Highford]] sits at the safest and most reliable crossing of the duchy’s main river artery, where east–west river traffic meets north–south road networks. Its position places it beyond the worst of the marshlands while still controlling access to the [[Fenward Marches]].


##### **[[Helwing Hold]]**

**Seat of the Duke**

- **Population:** ~5,000
- **Geographical Position:** [[Western ridges]], south of [[Highford]], overlooking the old stone road into the inner duchies
- **Role:** Ducal residence, high courts, archives, noble estates
- **Notes:** Built on defensible high ground, [[Helwing Hold]] commands road access rather than river trade. Its separation from [[Highford]] reflects an older model of rule, where authority was projected outward rather than embedded in commerce.


##### **[[Redmarsh]]**

- **Population:** ~2,000
- **Geographical Position:** Eastern [[Fenward Marches]], on a low ridge where the marsh gives way to stable ground beside a navigable tributary
- **Role:** Coal extraction, river barging, industrial workshops
- **Notes:** Redmarsh’s ridge location keeps it above seasonal flooding while allowing direct access to marsh-bound coal seams and river transport. It is the easternmost major settlement under firm ducal control.


##### **[[Grayfen Crossing]]**

- **Population:** ~6,500
- **Geographical Position:** North-eastern duchy, where the fen-rivers narrow into a controlled crossing
- **Role:** Toll collection, ferries, patrol mustering
- **Notes:** [[Grayfen Crossing]] controls one of the few reliable routes through the northern marshes. Its geography makes it a natural choke-point, explaining its heavy fortification and military presence.


##### **[[Brackenmere]]**

- **Population:** ~5,000
- **Geographical Position:** Southern Fenward edge, at the transition between marshland and arable lowland
- **Role:** Peat, livestock, and marsh agriculture
- **Notes:** [[Brackenmere]] sits where drier ground allows farming to supplement marsh resources. It serves as a food conduit between rural holdings and the eastern frontier towns.

##### **Other Towns & Holdings**

###### **Stonecross**
- **Population:** ~4,000
- **Geographical Position:** Western ridges, at the junction of two old military roads
- **Role:** Garrison town, road control, mustering point
###### **Willowreach**
- **Population:** ~3,500
- **Geographical Position:** Central lowlands, downstream from Highford along slow-moving river bends
- **Role:** Fishing, reeds, rivercraft, barge maintenance
###### **Villages & Hamlets**
- **Population:** ~30,000 combined
- **Geographical Position:** Scattered throughout the Helwing Lowlands and along minor river tributaries
- **Notes:** Many have absorbed refugees or been abandoned entirely, depending on proximity to marshland and trade routes.

#### **Population**

**Estimated total population:** ~120,000–130,000  
**Refugees:** ~20,000–25,000

##### **Species / Ancestry Breakdown (Approx.)**

- Humans: ~55%
- Dwarves: ~14%
- Halflings: ~7%
- Elves (mostly wood & marsh): ~6%
- Half-elves: ~5%
- Orcs & Half-orcs: ~8%
- Gnomes: ~3%
- Other ancestries: ~2%

Refugee populations skew heavily toward humans, orcs, and mixed-ancestry folk.

#### **Military Forces**

**Total available forces:** ~9,000–11,000

- Standing ducal troops: ~3,500
- Town militias: ~4,000
- River wardens & patrols: ~1,500
- Noble retainers & private forces: ~1,000

Command is fragmented. Loyalty is often owed to towns, patrons, or employers rather than the duchy as a whole.

#### **Governance & Current State**

With the Duke incapacitated:

- Ducal law is enforced unevenly
- Emergency powers persist without clear oversight
- Town assemblies wield unprecedented authority
- Economic and industrial interests increasingly shape policy

The duchy remains wealthy and populous—but politically stalled, socially strained, and dangerously exposed to external threat.
