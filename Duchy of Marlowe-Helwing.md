#### **Overview**

The **Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing** is a major eastern border realm, occupying fertile lowlands, river corridors, and the marsh-bound frontier known as the Fenward Marches. Historically a buffer state between the inner duchies and the eastern wilds, Marlowe-Helwing has long balanced decentralised local governance with ducal authority exercised from its ancestral seat.

In recent years, this balance has fractured. Multiple neighbouring regions have fallen to the advancing **[[Iron Host]]**, sending tens of thousands of refugees westward into the duchy. At the same time, [[Duke Helwing]]’s prolonged illness has left central authority paralysed, accelerating the rise of town councils, emergency powers, and regional strongmen.

#### **Geography**

The duchy spans three broad zones:

- **The Fenward Marches** – eastern marshlands, coal seams, peat flats, and river trade routes
- **The Helwing Lowlands** – arable farmland, baronial estates, and market towns
- **The Western Ridges** – higher ground, old stone roads, and fortified crossings

Rivers dominate transport and commerce, flowing westward toward safer inner realms.

#### **Major Regions**

##### **Fenward Marches**

A bleak but economically vital frontier region of fens, shallow ridges, and deep coal seams. It bears the brunt of refugee influx and Iron Host pressure. Governance here is highly decentralised, relying on town assemblies, mine councils, and emergency authorities.

#### **Major Settlements**

##### **[[Helwing Hold]]**

- **Population:** ~18,000

- **Population:** ~14,000
- **Role:** Major river crossing, customs house, grain and timber market

##### **Redmarsh**

- **Population:** ~2,000 (inflated by transient labour and refugees)
- **Role:** Coal extraction, river barging, industrial workshops
- **Notes:** Largest settlement in the Fenward Marches. Governed under emergency powers. Central to recent industrial expansion and political tension.
