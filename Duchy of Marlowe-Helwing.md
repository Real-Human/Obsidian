#### **Overview**

The **Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing** is a major eastern border realm, occupying fertile lowlands, river corridors, and the marsh-bound frontier known as the Fenward Marches. Historically a buffer state between the inner duchies and the eastern wilds, Marlowe-Helwing has long balanced decentralised local governance with ducal authority exercised from its ancestral seat.

In recent years, this balance has fractured. Multiple neighbouring regions have fallen to the advancing **[[Iron Host]]**, sending tens of thousands of refugees westward into the duchy. At the same time, [[Duke Helwing]]’s prolonged illness has left central authority paralysed, accelerating the rise of town councils, emergency powers, and regional strongmen.

#### **Capital and Seat of Power**

##### **On the Distinction Between Capital and Ducal Seat**

Although often referred to as a single “capital” in casual speech, Marlowe-Helwing maintains a long-standing division between **legal authority** and **practical governance**.

- **[[Helwing Hold]]** is the _ducal seat_: the site of the Duke’s court, high law, and the duchy’s archives.

- **[[Highford]]** is the _principal settlement_: the largest city and the economic, logistical, and political heart of the duchy.

This distinction has existed for generations, but has become critically important following the Duke’s incapacitation. Authority still formally emanates from [[Helwing Hold]], yet most decisions that affect daily life are now made—or enforced—in [[Highford]].

#### **Geography**

The duchy spans three broad zones:

- **The Fenward Marches** – eastern marshlands, peat flats, and deep coal seams
- **The Helwing Lowlands** – arable farmland, manors, and market towns
- **The Western Ridges** – higher ground, old stone roads, and fortified crossings

River travel dominates trade and communication, binding the duchy together even as political unity weakens.
