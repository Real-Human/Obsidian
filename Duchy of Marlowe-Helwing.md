#### **Overview**

The **Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing** is a major eastern border realm, occupying the lowlands and river-marsh systems between the inner duchies and the contested frontier now dominated by the **[[Iron Host]]**. Long regarded as a pragmatic, resource-rich duchy rather than a political powerhouse, Marlowe-Helwing has historically served as both a buffer state and an industrial supplier to the heartlands.

In the past decade, this role has been severely strained. Multiple neighbouring regions have fallen to the [[Iron Host]], pushing tens of thousands of refugees into Helwing territory. At the same time, [[Duke Helwing]]’s prolonged illness has left the duchy without clear central leadership, resulting in fractured authority, emergency governance, and increasing autonomy at the regional and town level.

## **Geography**

The duchy spans three broad zones:

- **The Fenward Marches** – eastern marshlands, coal seams, peat flats, and river trade routes
    
- **The Helwing Lowlands** – arable farmland, baronial estates, and market towns
    
- **The Western Ridges** – higher ground, old stone roads, and fortified crossings
    

Rivers dominate transport and commerce, flowing westward toward safer inner realms.
