#### **Overview**

Redmarsh is the largest settlement in the **[[Fenward Marches]]**, built atop a long, shallow ridge rising above the surrounding fens. A river cuts along the ridge’s eastern edge, providing a sheltered harbour while leaving the main town dry and defensible. The wider region is bleak and marsh-fringed, known for its deep coal seams and for containing the richest discovered deposits of **[[Wondrous Coal]]**—a rare and volatile mineral whose true value is **believed to be negligible by the public**, but quietly understood by a select few to hold unusual magical potential.

The town is shaped by industry: pitheads, workshops, timber barracks, and rail-lines dominate the landscape. Most of its people work in the mines or in trades that support them, forming a community defined by hard labour, river traffic, and the ever-present hum of extraction.

Since the rise of **[[Ephraim Gauge]]** to the mayoralty under _emergency powers_, Redmarsh has undergone rapid expansion and increasingly strict oversight. Coal output has surged, new infrastructure has been driven across the ridge, and pressure on both workers and civic institutions has grown. The result is a town both thriving and strained, its prosperity shadowed by growing tensions beneath the fog of the fens.

#### **Government and Politics**

##### Ephraim Gauge

Gauge serves as [[Redmarsh]]’s mayor and the ducal Overseer of Extraction. He maintains a polished public image—courteous with nobles, meticulous with reports, decisive in crises. Behind the scenes, he is known for his uncompromising expectations and skilful manipulation of local and ducal politics.  
He treats cooperation as a necessity and opposition as an inefficiency. Delegates who challenge him find themselves facing quiet pressures: redirected funds, lost permits, unexpected inspections.

Gauge insists his policies are essential for [[Redmarsh]]’s security and prosperity, especially with rumours of hostile forces massing beyond the marches.

##### Marta Goodwin

[[Commons’ Assembly|The Assembly]] is currently chaired by **[[Marta Goodwin]]**, a former caravan steward whose reputation for fairness and clarity earned her broad support. She approaches governance with steady pragmatism and relies on transparent accounting and open deliberation.

[[Marta Goodwin|Goodwin]] is one of the few public figures who can challenge [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] without resorting to theatrics or confrontation. She meets his proposals with patient scrutiny rather than defiance, which has earned her both respect and quiet resistance. While [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] frames his demands as necessities, [[Marta Goodwin|Goodwin]] champions measured growth, worker safety, and public accountability.

Under her leadership, [[Commons’ Assembly|the Assembly]] has become more organised, even as it faces increasing political pressure.

#### **Industry and Technology**

##### Mining and Wondrous Coal

Nearly all of [[Redmarsh]]’s wealth—and danger—comes from its mines. The upper seams yield ordinary coal, long exported to the duchy’s forges and kilns. The lower reaches, however, hide pockets of **[[Wondrous Coal]]**, a luminous mineral that destabilises easily when improperly handled.

Historically considered a curse more than a resource, [[Wondrous Coal]] only became viable after recent breakthroughs by the **[[Glasswrights’ Covenant]]**, who discovered methods of stabilising and harnessing its energy.

The benefits and value of [[Wondrous Coal]] however are kept hidden, known only the [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]], [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] and a few select associates.

##### The Glasswrights’ Covenant

The **[[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]] are an artificer guild specialising in engineered magic, glasscraft, and experimental devices powered by rare materials. Since relocating to Redmarsh, they have produced innovations vital to mining: stabilised safe-lamps, deep-ventilation systems, and compact winding engines.

The guild’s internal dynamics are a source of speculation.  
**[[Master Sola Meinh]]**, its founder, is widely admired for brilliance paired with stark pragmatism.  
**[[Aria “Spark” Vell]]**, a daring prodigy within the guild, is known to test boundaries—sometimes beyond what the mines’ overseers consider sensible.

[[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] maintains a careful partnership with the [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]], valuing their output while nudging their research toward his expanding extraction plans.

##### Current Tensions

Redmarsh sits at a precarious point:

- Mining grows ever deeper into unstable seams.
- [[Wondrous Coal]] extraction outpaces the town’s ability to manage its risks. 
- [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] pushes production to prepare for uncertain threats.
- The [[Commons’ Assembly]] struggles to maintain transparency and safety amid political strain.
- The [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]] continue to innovate in ways that promise progress but carry unknown consequences.

Despite its small population, Redmarsh has become a focal point of industry, ambition, and quietly growing unease.

#### **Major Locations of Redmarsh**

##### **Town Square**

The Town Square is the heart of Redmarsh: a packed, muddy intersection of trade, gossip, and community life. Market stalls crowd the open ground, carrying preserved food, tools, lamp-glass, and miners’ supplies. Notices from the mayor’s office and the [[Commons’ Assembly]] are posted here, though the [[Commons’ Assembly|Assembly]]’s messages often disappear faster than [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s.  
Travellers, carters, and miners gather here before shifts, making it the most reliable place in town to overhear rumours, resolve disputes, or find a job no one else wants.

##### **Gauge’s Hall (Mayor’s Office)**

A reinforced administrative hall overlooking the square, this is the seat of **[[Ephraim Gauge]]’s** emergency authority. Clerks work constantly inside: updating ledgers, preparing reports, and drafting new work decrees.  
[[Ephraim Gauge||Gauge]] keeps the building outwardly modest, but its interior houses improved security, sealed archives, and a private meeting room where he receives [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]]’ representatives.  
Delegates from the [[Commons’ Assembly]] come here reluctantly — sessions with [[Ephraim Gauge||Gauge]] are often tense.

##### **Assembly Chambers**

A sturdier stone and timber structure just off the square, the Assembly Chambers serve as the meeting place for Redmarsh’s elected delegates. The hall is plain but well-kept, with benches arranged in a half-circle around the Speaker’s desk.  
Arguments here are loud, direct, and usually interrupted by miners banging on the doors demanding clarification on new rules. Despite growing pressure from [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s office, the Chambers remain one of the few places where Redmarsh’s wider population can publicly question authority.

##### **The Glasswrights’ Yard (Workshop Enclave)**

Located just south-east of the central settlement, this cluster of angular workshops and test-yards belongs to the **[[Glasswrights’ Covenant]]**.  
The Yard produces:

- stabilised safe-lamps
- deep-ventilation devices
- experimental winding engines
- prototype tools for handling volatile material

The air here often hums with arcane tone or shivers with the snap of reheated glass. Outsiders aren’t allowed near the inner workshops, especially where [[Wondrous Coal]] stabilisation occurs.

##### **The Coal Mine (Main Excavation Pit)**

The largest and oldest mine in Redmarsh. Wooden supports, steam-driven lifts, and winding engines climb along the slope of the excavation. Carts constantly rattle across trestle bridges toward the river-handling stations.  
Miners know the upper seams well — predictable, if dangerous — but the deeper tunnels have recently been marked with red signals and limited-access postings. [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] attributes the restrictions to “unusual geological instability.”  
Only a handful of overseers understand what’s truly being extracted below: pockets of [[Wondrous Coal]].

##### **Mine Management Office**

A compact but heavily staffed building near the river crossing. Overseers, shift managers, and scribes coordinate output, record injuries, and track “hazardous refuse disposal.”  
It’s also where [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] channels his reporting system: numbers are relentlessly collected and polished before being sent to ducal officials.  
Workers come here to dispute shifts, request compensation, or — more often — be told to return with proper paperwork.

##### **River Barge Docks**

The timbered docks beneath the mine are essential to Redmarsh’s output. Barges carry coal downstream to larger trade arteries.  
The docks operate day and night, lit by the [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]]’ safe-lamps.  

##### **Ironbridge (Local Term)**

A sturdy bridge crossing the Fenward River, used to transport ore and supplies. Although humble in appearance, it has been reinforced repeatedly to withstand heavy cartloads.  
Some locals claim it shakes differently when [[Wondrous Coal]] passes over it, though no one but [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s associates know why.

##### **The Dockside Quarter**

A string of small worker huts, contract houses, and crate-yards lining the riverbank opposite the main mine. This area houses temporary workers, river-haulers, and carters. Conditions are cramped but lively: dice games, cheap food, and late-night arguments are common.

##### **Windmill & Outlying Farm Plots**

Across the eastern road stands a functioning windmill supporting the small agricultural plots that feed Redmarsh. Grain from these fields is milled into coarse flour that sustains most workers.  
Although the farmland is modest, it’s critical — without it, Redmarsh would rely entirely on expensive imports.

##### **Southern Farmland & Livestock Pens**

A mix of grain fields, small vegetable patches, and fenced livestock areas. These farms sit on firmer ground than the marshlands and supply Redmarsh with what little fresh food it produces.  
Farmers frequently petition the Assembly for road maintenance, as cart-ruts and flooding often isolate them from town.

##### **The River Watchtower**

A lone structure placed east of the main settlement, overlooking the bends of the Fenward River. Officially, it monitors barge traffic and deters river raiders.  
Unofficially, its garrison has been instructed to intercept any unscheduled boats approaching Redmarsh — one of many quiet practices [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] has implemented.

#### **Geography**

Redmarsh’s distinctive terrain is central to its character:

- **The Ridge:**  
    A naturally raised strip of compact earth running north–south, offering stable foundations in an otherwise marshy landscape. Most homes, workshops, and civic buildings sit atop this ridge.
- **The River Cut:**  
    The river has carved a narrow channel along the eastern edge of the ridge. This creates a sheltered dock area below the town level, allowing barge traffic to move coal and goods through the fenland waterways.
- **The Surrounding Fens:**  
    Mist-laden wetlands stretch outward, used for grazing, reed gathering, limited farming, and barge transport. Floodwaters collect here, rarely rising as far as the ridge itself.

This geography grants Redmarsh both safety from floods and convenient access to water transport—an unusual advantage in the [[Fenward Marches|Marches]].

#### **Economy**

Redmarsh’s economy is driven by:

- **Coal Mining:**  
    The primary industry. Production has increased rapidly under [[Ephraim Gauge|Mayor Gauge]]'s direction. Mine entrances sit on the ridge’s stable ground, tunnelling downward toward deeper coal seams.  
    _Unknown to the public_, fragments of rare [[Wondrous Coal]] are secretly transferred to the [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]] rather than discarded.
- **Barge Transport:**  
    The river cut allows for robust barge trade, shipping coal downstream and bringing in timber, grain, and tools.
- **Craft and Repair Trades:**  
    Local carpenters, blacksmiths, and cartwrights support both miners and river workers.
