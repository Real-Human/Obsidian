_Artificer Guild of Redmarsh_

The **Glasswrights** are a small but rapidly rising **artificer guild** based in **[[Redmarsh]]**, known for their experimental work blending glasscraft, engineered magic, and arcane machinery. Their most controversial and influential work revolves around **[[Wondrous Coal]]**, a volatile magical material that only they have learned to stabilise and harness.

In the philosophical landscape of [[Redmarsh]], the Glasswrights represent **the Ugly**:  
visionaries whose inventions often sit uneasily between progress and peril.

#### **Philosophy and Identity**

The Glasswrights are **artificers first and foremost**—craftspeople who channel magic through tools, devices, materials, and mechanisms rather than pure spellcasting. Their core belief is:

> **Magic should be built, shaped, and engineered—not merely cast.**

They pursue:

- infused devices
- arcane engines
- magically resonant glass matrices
- stabilised magical fuels
- mechanised spell-channeling systems

This puts them at odds with traditional mages, who view their work as unpredictable, unsafe, or philosophically misguided.

The internal divide within the guild aligns with the triad of **Good, Bad, and Ugly**, embodied by their three leading figures.

#### Key Figures

##### **Master Sola Meinh**

**Founder, Guildmate, Senior Artificer — Embodiment of the Ugly**

###### **Overview:**  
Sola Meinh is the founding artificer of the Glasswrights and the architect of their philosophy. Her grand vision of a future powered by engineered magic drives the guild’s direction. She sees Wondrous Coal as the foundation of a new artificer age—one she feels destined to usher in.

###### **Traits:**

- visionary, cerebral, methodical
- fixated on long-term innovation
- blind to social or ethical fallout
- deeply devoted to the guild’s mission

###### **Role:**  
Sola legitimises the guild, sets its research priorities, and maintains its philosophical core. Her decision to establish the guild in [[Redmarsh]] stemmed from the region’s unusually rich deposits of [[Wondrous Coal]].

##### **Aria “Spark” Vell**

**Prodigy Artificer, Radical Innovator — Embodiment of the Bad**

###### **Overview:**  
Aria Vell—nicknamed **Spark**—is a prodigious artificer whose talent is matched only by her recklessness. She pushes [[Wondrous Coal]] research to its limits, dismissing ethics and safety as obstacles that slow progress.

###### **Traits:**

- dangerously curious
- fiercely ambitious
- intolerant of restraint
- charismatic and compelling

###### **Role:**  
Spark drives the most extreme experimental work: unstable infusions, prototype arcane engines, volatile power sources. Many of the guild’s greatest (and most hazardous) breakthroughs come from her hand.

##### **Liran Dovetail**

**Artisan-Engineer, Field Artificer — Embodiment of the Good**

###### **Overview:**  
Liran Dovetail is the guild’s conscience and the most community-focused artificer within the Glasswrights. They believe technology and magic must serve and protect everyday people. Liran specialises in safe, practical applications that improve minework and daily life in [[Redmarsh]].

###### **Traits:**

- compassionate and principled
- cautious, thoughtful, and pragmatic
- trusted by apprentices and miners
- quietly resistant to unethical projects

###### **Role:**  
Liran designed many of the guild’s everyday devices:

- **safe-lamps**
- **ventilators**
- **stability charms for [[Wondrous Coal]]**
- **fail-safe mechanisms for volatile arcane tools**

#### **The Glasswrights and Wondrous Coal**

As artificers, the Glasswrights are uniquely suited to work with [[Wondrous Coal]]. Their understanding of infused materials and containment matrices allowed them to develop the **first known stabilisation method**.

While the rest of the world rejects the mineral as useless or dangerous, the Glasswrights see potential that borders on revolutionary.

Their stabilised samples now fuel:

- crystalline engines
- controlled arcane reactors
- prototype forged items
- experimental constructs

The guild believes they have only scratched the surface of what Wondrous Coal can do.

##### **Relationship with Gauge**

The Glasswrights provide **[[Ephraim Gauge]]** with several key artificer-made devices:

- ventilators for deep mines
- safe-lamps resistant to volatile gases
- winding engines for heavy lifting and tunnel work

[[Ephraim Gauge| Gauge]] values their expertise and sees strategic potential in their inventions—especially with the War Troll threat looming.

It is _uncertain_, but increasingly suspected, that Gauge hopes to commission the guild for:

- weaponry,
- armour,
- or other combat-grade artificer devices.

Internally:

- Spark is eager for the opportunity.
- Liran fears the ethical fallout.
- Sola sees it as a necessary evolution of their craft.

##### **Current Status**

The Glasswrights remain a small, localised artificer guild—ambitious, controversial, and increasingly entangled in [[Redmarsh]]’s unfolding conflict. Their work with [[Wondrous Coal]] places them at a pivotal moment in the region’s future, where their inventions could save lives, reshape industry, or ignite disaster.

Their fate will depend on which of their three philosophies—Good, Bad, or Ugly—ultimately steers the guild.
