#### **Overview**

The **Displaced Companies** are a loose confederation of former soldiers from multiple northern realms and border states destroyed or overrun by the **[[Iron Host]]**. Once members of organised armies—levies, border regiments, city guards, and professional troops—they now operate as an irregular force within and beyond the borders of the **[[Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing]]**.

They are not mercenaries, nor a militia in the usual sense. They are what remains when armies break but soldiers survive.

#### **Origins**

The Displaced Companies formed from the remnants of defeated forces retreating south and west as northern territories fell. Some units withdrew intact but leaderless; others were reduced to handfuls of veterans after encirclement, retreat, or annihilation of their parent formations.

Early attempts at absorption into foreign command structures failed. Mismatched doctrines, distrust of distant authorities, and the trauma of collapse led many survivors to reject permanent subordination. Instead, experienced officers and non-commissioned leaders began organising survivors into mobile companies, preserving what discipline they could while abandoning rigid hierarchy.

Their consolidation accelerated once Iron Host scouts and outriders began operating beyond the highlands. These encounters proved that uncoordinated survival was not enough.
