#### **Overview**

The **Displaced Companies** are a loose confederation of former soldiers from multiple northern realms and border states destroyed or overrun by the **[[Iron Host]]**. Once members of organised armies—levies, border regiments, city guards, and professional troops—they now operate as an irregular force within and beyond the borders of the **[[Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing]]**.

They are not mercenaries, nor a militia in the usual sense. They are what remains when armies break but soldiers survive.
