#### **Overview**

The **Displaced Companies** are a confederation of former soldiers drawn from the shattered armies of northern duchies, kingdoms, and freeholds overrun by the **[[Iron Host]]**. Once sworn to banners that no longer fly, they now operate as an irregular military force within and beyond the borders of the **[[Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing]]**.

They are neither mercenaries nor bandits. Every fighter within the Companies was trained, armed, and blooded as part of a formal army. What unites them is not loyalty to a new state, but the shared experience of defeat, retreat, and survival when command collapsed and homelands were lost.

#### **Origins**

As the [[Iron Host]] advanced through the northern and north-eastern regions, entire armies were broken. Some were destroyed outright; others disintegrated during withdrawal as supply lines failed and political authority evaporated. Thousands fled south. Most laid down their arms. Some did not.

Small groups of officers and veteran soldiers began gathering survivors along retreat routes, initially for mutual defence. Over time, repeated contact with Iron Host scouts and raiding parties forced these groups to coordinate. Discipline returned, not as parade-ground formality, but as a matter of survival.

The name _Displaced Companies_ emerged organically, used by towns and officials to describe armed refugee groups who were clearly soldiers, but no longer belonged to any recognised army.

#### **Organisation & Command**

The Displaced Companies do not constitute a single unified army. They are a network of semi-independent formations, each tracing its lineage to a fallen realm or banner.

- **Company size:** 30–100 fighters
- **Total strength:** ~700–1,000 (variable)
- **Composition:** Former infantry, scouts, engineers, guards, and officers
- **Command:** Veteran leadership recognised by consensus and competence

A single war-leader acts as _first among equals_, coordinating strategy, mediating disputes, and maintaining unity between companies. Authority is practical, not absolute; leaders who fail to protect their people lose standing quickly.

#### **Relationship with the Duchy**

The Duchy’s position remains unresolved.

- **[[Highford]]** treats the Companies as a de facto auxiliary force
- **[[Grayfen Crossing]]** relies on them as a forward screen
- **[[Helwing Hold]]** has never formally legitimised them

Officially, they “do not exist.” In practice, they are supplied, warned, and occasionally guided—just never acknowledged.

#### **Doctrine & Tactics**

Though no longer a conventional army, the Displaced Companies fight like professionals adapting to defeat.

They specialise in:

- Delaying actions and fighting withdrawals
- Ambushes using disciplined fire and coordinated movement
- Denial of terrain rather than occupation
- Harassment of [[Iron Host]] reconnaissance and logistics

They avoid static defence and large formations, having learned—often painfully—that this is where the [[Iron Host]] is strongest.
