#### **Overview**

The **Displaced Companies** are a confederation of former soldiers drawn from the shattered armies of northern duchies, kingdoms, and freeholds overrun by the **[[Iron Host]]**. Once sworn to banners that no longer fly, they now operate as an irregular military force within and beyond the borders of the **[[Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing]]**.

They are neither mercenaries nor bandits. Every fighter within the Companies was trained, armed, and blooded as part of a formal army. What unites them is not loyalty to a new state, but the shared experience of defeat, retreat, and survival when command collapsed and homelands were lost.

#### **Origins**

The **Displaced Companies** formed from the remnants of defeated forces retreating south and west as northern territories fell. Some units withdrew intact but leaderless; others were reduced to handfuls of veterans after encirclement, retreat, or annihilation of their parent formations.

Early attempts at absorption into foreign command structures failed. Mismatched doctrines, distrust of distant authorities, and the trauma of collapse led many survivors to reject permanent subordination. Instead, experienced officers and non-commissioned leaders began organising survivors into mobile companies, preserving what discipline they could while abandoning rigid hierarchy.

Their consolidation accelerated once [[Iron Host]] scouts and outriders began operating beyond the highlands. These encounters proved that uncoordinated survival was not enough.

#### **Organisation & Command**

The Displaced Companies retain military discipline, but not a formal army structure.

- **Company size:** 30–80 fighters
- **Total strength:** ~700–1,000
- **Composition:** Former infantry, skirmishers, engineers, and artillery crews (now repurposed)
- **Command:** Veteran officers recognised by experience, not rank papers

A single war-leader is widely acknowledged as _first among equals_, coordinating strategy and mediation between companies. Authority is practical rather than absolute, leaders who fail are replaced quietly.

#### **Relationship with the Duchy**

The Duchy’s position remains unresolved.

- **[[Highford]]** treats the Companies as a de facto auxiliary force
- **[[Grayfen Crossing]]** relies on them as a forward screen
- **[[Helwing Hold]]** has never formally legitimised them

Officially, they “do not exist.” In practice, they are supplied, warned, and occasionally guided—just never acknowledged.

#### **Doctrine & Tactics**

Though no longer a conventional army, the Displaced Companies fight like professionals adapting to defeat.

They specialise in:

- Delaying actions and fighting withdrawals
- Ambushes using disciplined fire and coordinated movement
- Denial of terrain rather than occupation
- Harassment of [[Iron Host]] reconnaissance and logistics

They avoid static defence and large formations, having learned—often painfully—that this is where the [[Iron Host]] is strongest.
