#### **Overview**

The **Displaced Companies** are a confederation of former soldiers drawn from the shattered armies of northern duchies, kingdoms, and freeholds overrun by the **[[Iron Host]]**. Once sworn to banners that no longer fly, they now operate as an irregular military force within and beyond the borders of the **[[Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing]]**.

They are neither mercenaries nor bandits. Every fighter within the Companies was trained, armed, and blooded as part of a formal army. What unites them is not loyalty to a new state, but the shared experience of defeat, retreat, and survival when command collapsed and homelands were lost.

#### **Origins**

As the [[Iron Host]] advanced through the northern and north-eastern regions, entire armies were broken. Some were destroyed outright; others disintegrated during withdrawal as supply lines failed and political authority evaporated. Thousands fled south. Most laid down their arms. Some did not.

Small groups of officers and veteran soldiers began gathering survivors along retreat routes, initially for mutual defence. Over time, repeated contact with Iron Host scouts and raiding parties forced these groups to coordinate. Discipline returned, not as parade-ground formality, but as a matter of survival.

The name _Displaced Companies_ emerged organically, used by towns and officials to describe armed refugee groups who were clearly soldiers, but no longer belonged to any recognised army.

#### **Organisation & Command**

The Displaced Companies do not constitute a single unified army. They are a network of semi-independent formations, each tracing its lineage to a fallen realm or banner.

- **Company size:** 30–100 fighters
- **Total strength:** ~700–1,000 (variable)
- **Composition:** Former infantry, scouts, engineers, guards, and officers
- **Command:** Veteran leadership recognised by consensus and competence

A single war-leader acts as _first among equals_, coordinating strategy, mediating disputes, and maintaining unity between companies. Authority is practical, not absolute; leaders who fail to protect their people lose standing quickly.

#### **Composition & Origins**

Unlike most forces, the Displaced Companies are organised by **where they came from**, not how they fight. Each company preserves fragments of its former army’s culture, doctrine, and grievances.

##### **The Gray Banner Remnants**

**Formerly:** Allied Armies of the Northern March Kingdoms  
**Estimated Strength:** ~180

Once the professional core of several border states, these troops survived a prolonged fighting withdrawal through collapsing defensive lines.

- Maintain strict discipline and internal hierarchy
- Favour shield formations and controlled retreats
- Deeply distrust political authorities after abandonment

They form the closest thing the Companies have to a conventional battle line.

##### **The Highcrest Survivors**

**Formerly:** Duchy of Highcrest (mountain realm)  
**Estimated Strength:** ~120

Highcrest fell defending the highland passes now controlled by the Iron Host. Its survivors are methodical and uncompromising.

- Specialists in pass denial and ambush
- Heavy use of terrain traps and collapses
- Known for aggressive counter-scouting

They often operate furthest beyond the frontier.

##### **The Fenward Exiles**

**Formerly:** Eastern Fenward Freeholds  
**Estimated Strength:** ~150

Drawn from fen-bound city militias and river guards, the Exiles excel in marsh and river warfare.

- Experts in shallow water and night movement
- Prefer harassment and withdrawal over decisive engagement
- Maintain quiet ties with fen communities

They view Marlowe-Helwing as the last surviving frontier, not a patron.

##### **The Black Standard**

**Formerly:** Royal Host of Karrowen  
**Estimated Strength:** ~90

Karrowen’s army was destroyed in a single catastrophic defeat. Survivors cling to old command traditions despite their impracticality.

- Retain formal ranks and drill
- Strong internal discipline
- Ongoing tension between obedience and necessity

Their officers struggle most with the loss of legitimate authority.

##### **The Last Oath Companies**

**Formerly:** Garrisons of annihilated cities  
**Estimated Strength:** ~200

These fighters come from settlements that no longer exist.

- No shared heraldry or doctrine
- Fatalistic but unbreakable morale
- Frequently volunteer for rearguard and holding actions

They are widely respected and quietly feared.

##### **The Broken Crown Guard**

**Formerly:** Ducal Guard of a fallen duchy  
**Estimated Strength:** ~60

Once elite household troops, now reduced to a hardened cadre.

- Superior equipment and training
- Politically silent and deeply watchful
- Refuse to swear new oaths

Their presence unsettles the nobility of Marlowe-Helwing.
