**Type:** Civil representative council  
**Location:** [[Redmarsh]], [[Fenward Marches]]  
**Leadership:** [[Marta Goodwin]] (Speaker)  
**Membership:** Elected delegates from mining districts, trade houses, and outlying settlements  
**Purpose:** Public governance, labour oversight, civic welfare, accountability

#### **Overview**

The **Commons’ Assembly** serves as [[Redmarsh]]’s civilian governing body, representing workers, local guilds, and surrounding villages. It traditionally holds authority over labour standards, mine charters, taxation, and local infrastructure.

In recent years, as [[Redmarsh]]’s mining operations have expanded under **[[Ephraim Gauge]]**, the Assembly has found itself increasingly strained. It remains the only public institution capable of questioning the pace, safety, and administration of the town’s industrial growth.

What the Assembly does _not_ know—and has no reason to suspect—is that a significant portion of deeper-seam material is not mere waste, but the volatile mineral known as **[[Wondrous Coal]]**. Its properties and value are deliberately concealed from them.

#### **Structure and Membership**

The Assembly includes around two dozen delegates:

- **Mining ward representatives** elected by pithead blocs
- **Trade and craft delegates** from river-haulers, smithies, and carters
- **Village envoys** from the surrounding marshland settlements
- **Guild-affiliated members** from workshops and mills

Debates are open to the public, and sessions are characterised by direct speech, practical concerns, and the insistence that officials justify risks taken in the mines.

#### **Leadership: Marta Goodwin**

**[[Marta Goodwin]]**, former caravan steward and widely respected for her steady judgement, serves as Speaker. Her leadership emphasises transparency, measured growth, and accountability.

[[Marta Goodwin|Goodwin]] regularly challenges [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s proposals—not confrontationally, but through careful questioning and insistence on clear evidence, especially where worker welfare is concerned.

Her diligence has helped the Assembly remain functional in a climate where many governing roles have been overshadowed by emergency authority.

#### **Relationship with Ephraim Gauge**

[[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] appears in Assembly sessions when required, presenting detailed production figures and reports crafted to withstand scrutiny. However, the information he shares is selective by design.

He allows the Assembly to believe that the unstable, glowing fragments found in deeper seams are **dangerous waste material**, collected and discreetly destroyed. In truth, these deposits are the prized **[[Wondrous Coal]]**, which he quietly transfers to the **[[Glasswrights’ Covenant]]** for stabilisation and experimentation.

Only [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]], the [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]], and a handful of trusted mine overseers know the truth. Most miners think the material is too hazardous to store and must be destroyed; the Assembly has accepted this explanation without yet seeing cause for suspicion.

This secrecy allows [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] to justify:

- increased security around certain tunnels,
- restricted reporting from deeper shafts,
- and unusual levels of collaboration with the [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]].

For now, the Assembly attributes these measures to safety concerns rather than hidden commerce.

#### **Major Concerns and Debates**

##### **1. Working Conditions and Mine Stability**

Increasing depth and unusual geological activity have prompted numerous debates over ventilation, bracing, and enforced rest hours. Delegates have raised alarm about rising injuries and the strain on mining communities.

Their concerns are valid—but they do not yet realise that many hazards are caused by the concealed presence of [[Wondrous Coal]].

##### **2. Disposal of “Volatile Refuse”**

[[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s reports frequently reference the careful neutralisation of unstable refuse taken from the deepest shafts.  
The Assembly regards these practices as sensible precautions.  
Unbeknownst to them, this “refuse” is the source of [[Redmarsh]]’s growing wealth and of [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s secret dealings.

##### **3. Oversight of the Glasswrights’ Covenant**

The [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]]’ expanding role in mine safety equipment has prompted mild concern.  
Their contract work appears innocuous: ventilators, safe-lamps, winding engines.  
Nothing in the Assembly’s view points toward the deeper partnership hidden behind closed doors.

##### **4. Emergency Powers and Transparency**

A recurring theme in debates is the need to restore regular governance procedures.  
Delegates question why certain reports arrive late, why some tunnels are sealed without explanation, and why [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s authority has remained unchecked for so long.

They lack one crucial piece of information—knowledge of a resource whose existence would transform the political landscape overnight.

#### **Current Standing**

The Commons’ Assembly remains the closest thing [[Redmarsh]] has to a public conscience. It pushes for safety, fairness, and oversight, even as it grapples with incomplete information and mounting pressure from the mayor’s office.

Unaware of the hidden trade beneath their feet, the Assembly debates the symptoms of a problem whose true cause has been thoroughly concealed.

How long this imbalance can remain undiscovered is an open question—both for [[Redmarsh]]’s politics and for its people.

#### **Internal Dynamics**

Within the Commons’ Assembly, delegates tend to fall into a few broad patterns of thought, though none of these form formal groups or acknowledged factions.

Some members are driven chiefly by **concerns for public welfare and miner safety**. They often come from districts where accidents are common or from villages with close-knit communities dependent on the mines for survival. These delegates favour caution, transparency, and thorough oversight. They push for safety inspections, resist rushed proposals, and challenge decisions that seem inadequately justified.

Others are more inclined toward **rapid growth, political opportunity, or maintaining easy cooperation with the mayor’s office**. These individuals frequently represent trade interests, wards that have benefited from [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s patronage, or personal ambitions. They tend to support expanded output, streamline approvals, and avoid debates that might slow production or risk their standing.

Between these sits a quieter set of delegates motivated by **practical concerns and economic stability**. Often older, technically minded, or experienced in logistics, they prioritise keeping [[Redmarsh]] functioning smoothly. They are open to expansion when needed but wary of excess, balancing the pressures of industry with the capacities of the town. They seldom press for confrontation, preferring workable solutions and incremental change.

These differing instincts — caution, ambition, and pragmatism — shape the Assembly’s debates, alliances, and hesitations, even though no member would frame themselves as belonging to anything more than their own perspective.
