**Wondrous Coal**, often called **witchfire coal** or simply **bad coal**, is an exceptionally rare and volatile magical mineral found in deep coal seams. Glowing with a cold, unwavering white light and possessing remarkable arcane potential, it is both feared and coveted across the region. Though long dismissed as too unstable to be useful, it has recently become the centre of intense study by the **[[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]]**, a small but visionary guild based primarily in **[[Redmarsh]]**.

#### **Appearance**

Wondrous Coal typically forms as **pea-sized nodules**, each one shining with a steady white glow. These tiny gems of light stand in stark contrast to the black dust and rock around them.

In extremely rare cases, significantly **larger pieces** are found—irregular clusters or crystalline masses large enough to fill a hand or even both. Such discoveries are historically significant and always shrouded in secrecy.

#### **Rarity and Occurrence**

Geologically, Wondrous Coal is **astonishingly rare**. Not all coal seams contain it—in fact, **most mines will never produce even a single piece**. Its presence is not tied to known geological predictors, causing great frustration for scholars attempting to map or understand its formation.

Because of its volatility, many miners who stumble across it initially treat it as a cursed substance, and superstitions surrounding it are widespread.

##### Known Locations

- [[Redmarsh]]


#### Volatility

Freshly mined Wondrous Coal is **highly unstable**:

- Exposure to air can provoke sparking white arcs of energy.
- Pieces may hum, vibrate, or crack.
- Mishandled nodules sometimes fracture violently, releasing short, dangerous bursts of magical force.
- Burning it produces unpredictable magical reactions rather than heat, making it extremely feared by the uninitiated.

This volatility led many early miners and scholars to consider it cursed or worthless. Most pieces were instinctively thrown away, buried, or destroyed.

#### **Historical Use and General Perception**

For the majority of its known history, Wondrous Coal was seen as **useless at best, dangerous at worst**. Few scholars or artificers attempted to study it, as traditional magical materials were far safer and more reliable.

As a result:

- Knowledge about it remained sparse.
- It was excluded from standard magical texts.
- Most cultures developed minor superstitions around it rather than practical uses.

#### **Recent Interest**

Only recently has Wondrous Coal begun to attract attention, primarily due to **new stabilisation techniques** discovered by the [[Glasswrights’ Covenant]]. These techniques are capable of rendering the coal significantly safer to handle, allowing it to be exposed to air without triggering its usual volatile reactions.

This breakthrough has opened the door—cautiously—to further study and the possibility of new applications.

While these methods are not widely disseminated, they have already shifted the perception of Wondrous Coal from a useless hazard to a material with potential, albeit one that remains poorly understood.

#### **Early Attempts and Abandonment**

Before the rise of the Glasswrights, many small attempts were made across the centuries to harness Wondrous Coal. All failed, largely due to:

- its instability,
- its rarity,
- and the reliability of safer magical alternatives.

Traditional arcane practice already offered stable cores, gemstones, and enchantment methods. Compared to these, Wondrous Coal seemed like more danger than opportunity.

#### **The Glasswrights: Pioneers of the Impossible**

The **[[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]]**, a small but visionary guild present mainly in Redmarsh, are the **first to truly pursue Wondrous Coal’s potential**. While others dismissed it, they saw possibility—and meaning—where others saw only hazard.

The Glasswrights firmly believe:

> _“Wondrous Coal, once mastered, will surpass all known magic.”_

They claim discovery of only the earliest principles of its nature, convinced that its true potential is vast and largely untapped.

##### **The Stabilisation Breakthrough**

Their most important achievement is the development of a method to **stabilise freshly mined Wondrous Coal**, allowing it to be safely handled and exposed to air. Though their methods are secret, known practices include:

- **Vacuum-lined extraction canisters** used in the mine itself.
- **Glass-mediated cool-forging**, bathing the coal in carefully controlled arcane energies.
- **Sigil-binding**, etching stabilising runes into the coal’s surface using a specialised tool called a _whisper-etcher_.
- **Crystalline matrices** that suppress arcane surges.

Once stabilised, Wondrous Coal becomes dramatically more predictable. It can be:

- touched safely,
- transported and stored without arcane outbursts,
- and worked into magical constructs.

Its glow softens to a steady, contained brilliance while retaining its potent magical properties.

#### **Uses**

##### **Glasswright Craft**

The Glasswrights use Wondrous Coal to:

- **Forge magical items**, enhancing enchantments through the coal’s unparalleled arcane conductivity.
- **Power their devices**, from crystalline engines to precision focusing mechanisms.
- **Experiment with advanced magical engineering**, including speculative machinery that could operate independently of spellcasters.

They believe stabilised Wondrous Coal will form the foundation of a new magical age—one based not on spellcasting, but on engineered arcane systems.

##### **Others**

No other known group possesses the skill to stabilise or safely work Wondrous Coal. Most outsiders continue to fear it, and miners continue to treat it with suspicion.

##### **Handling and Containment**

Before stabilisation, Wondrous Coal must be handled with extreme caution:

- kept in sealed, inert canisters,
- padded against shock,
- kept away from open flame,
- and transported under the supervision of trained extractors.

After the Glasswrights’ stabilisation process, it becomes suitable for:

- forging,
- machining,
- arcane integration,
- and long-term storage.
