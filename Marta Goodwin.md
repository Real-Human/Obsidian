**Species:** Dwarf  
**Occupation:** Speaker of the [[Commons’ Assembly]] ([[Redmarsh]])  
**Affiliation:** [[Redmarsh]] [[Commons’ Assembly]]  
**Status:** Active

#### **Overview**

Marta Goodwin is a **dwarven Speaker of the [[Commons’ Assembly]]**, renowned in [[Redmarsh]] for her steadiness, sharp pragmatism, and fierce loyalty to the town’s working folk. In a community bound to coal seams, river trade, and marshland hardship, her dwarven heritage makes her a natural fit for representing miners, labourers, and families whose livelihoods depend on the land.

Calm under pressure and resolute in purpose, Marta is one of the few political figures in [[Redmarsh]] still trusted broadly despite the rising influence of [[Ephraim Gauge]].

#### **Physical Description — Marta Goodwin**

Marta Goodwin is a **stocky, broad-shouldered dwarf** in her middle years, standing a little over **4 feet tall** with the grounded, balanced posture typical of her people. Her build is sturdy rather than heavy, shaped by years of travel, hauling provisions, and walking marsh roads during her caravan days.

Her **skin is a warm, weathered umber**, marked by faint lines at the corners of her eyes from a lifetime of squinting into river mist and reading documents by lamplight. She keeps her **hair cropped short**, a practical salt-and-iron grey that curls slightly in the Redmarsh damp. A neatly braided beardlet—just a pair of thin plaits at her chin—signals her maturity and cultural pride without drawing pompous attention.

Marta’s **eyes are a steady river-green**, expressive but rarely dramatic, with a gaze known for lingering just long enough to make Assembly delegates reconsider a weak argument. Her expression tends toward thoughtful neutrality, though she carries an easy half-smile when speaking with townsfolk.

Her clothing is practical, favouring **sturdy wool, reinforced leather trim, and deep earth tones**. She wears a long, marsh-green coat with weatherproof lining, a remnant of her stewarding days, and a belt pouch full of annotated notes, charcoal sticks, and folded correspondence. On her wrists sit **simple brass bangles**, worn smooth by age—gifts from her caravan years she has never parted with.

Nothing about Marta is ostentatious, yet she has a natural presence: **solid, dependable, and quietly authoritative**, the sort of figure people instinctively gather around when decisions must be made.

#### **First Impressions — Marta Goodwin**

When Marta Goodwin enters the room, the first thing you notice is her **presence**—not loud or commanding, but solid, like a stone set perfectly into the earth. A **broad-shouldered dwarven woman** of modest height, she moves with a steady, deliberate confidence. Her coat is a deep marsh-green wool, worn at the edges but carefully maintained, and a small stack of folded papers peeks from one pocket.

Her **grey hair is cropped short**, practical for work, with two neat braids at her chin marking her age and standing. Her river-green eyes settle on each of you in turn—calm, assessing, patient. There’s no suspicion in her gaze, only the quiet calculation of someone who has mediated more disputes than she’s had hot dinners.

When she speaks, her voice carries a **warm, gravelled steadiness**, the tone of someone accustomed to being listened to without needing to raise it. She offers a small, polite nod—respectful, but not deferential.

You get the immediate impression of a woman who is:

- **dependable**,
- **difficult to intimidate**,
- and very used to handling problems that other people would rather ignore.

Even before she introduces herself as the Speaker of the Commons’ Assembly, you can tell she’s someone the town looks to when things start going wrong.

#### **Background**

##### **Early Life & Caravan Work**

Marta grew up in a small dwarven community on the southern edge of the [[Fenward Marches]].  
In her _late adolescence_, before settling in [[Redmarsh]], she worked as a **caravan steward** for a mixed dwarven–human trade route. Her responsibilities included:

- managing manifests,
- settling disputes between drivers and merchants,
- planning safe routes around marsh hazards,
- negotiating with barge families and river captains when goods needed to transfer to water routes.

This experience explains:

- her organisation skills,
- her mediation abilities,
- her understanding of regional trade and labour issues,
- and why she is widely respected for calm, steady judgement.

##### **Arrival in Redmarsh**

During a devastating period of regional flooding, her caravan was rerouted through [[Redmarsh]]. Marta stayed to help coordinate **local relief and logistics**, working alongside barge families to distribute supplies and reconnect isolated households.

Her calm handling of the crisis impressed many locals.

##### **Rise in the Commons’ Assembly**

After remaining in [[Redmarsh]], she continued to mediate disputes—initially among dockworkers and miners—leading the Dockside Quarter to nominate her as their [[Commons’ Assembly|Assembly]] delegate.  
Her caravan experience made her:

- good at balancing competing interests,
- patient but assertive in negotiations,
- deeply committed to accountability and clear procedure.

She was later elected **Speaker** for these very strengths.

#### **Role as Speaker**

Marta’s leadership style is shaped by dwarven sensibilities: methodical decision-making, respect for community labour, and an insistence that promises made must be kept.

As Speaker, she:

- Chairs debates and ensures quieter delegates are not overrun by ambitious voices.
- Conducts negotiations with [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s Hall, often acting as a protective buffer for the public.  
- Drives initiatives focused on miner safety, fair pay, and transparency around industrial expansion.  
- Pushes the [[Commons’ Assembly|Assembly]] toward practical, consensus-driven solutions rather than political posturing.  

While she rarely challenges [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]] directly, she is one of the few who can match his resolve—and he knows it.

#### **Political Stance and Behaviour**

Marta commonly aligns with the [[Commons’ Assembly|Assembly]]’s public-welfare-focused members.  
Her motivations centre on:

- Protecting miners and river workers from exploitation
- Maintaining safety standards as the mines deepen
- Preserving the communal traditions of the Marshes
- Avoiding rash growth that could harm the town

She distrusts secretiveness for its own sake and is quietly determined to uncover why [[Ephraim Gauge|Gauge]]’s mine expansion has become so urgent.

#### **Reputation**

[[Redmarsh]]’s folk see Marta as:

- Down-to-earth
- Honest to a fault  
- A dependable voice in unstable times  
- Someone who understands both the mines and the marshes  

To miners, her dwarven nature makes her feel like “one of their own”; to the rivermen, she is a steady hand; to the [[Commons’ Assembly|Assembly]], she is the anchor that keeps the chamber from drifting into chaos.
