**Ephraim Gauge** is the de-facto ruler of [[Redmarsh]], a coal-boom town in the [[Fenward Marches]] of the [[Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing]]. Though not noble by birth, he holds the mayoralty by “emergency decree” and controls the mine lease, weigh-house, lamp-room, and the two causeway checkpoints. Admired by some for order and wages paid on time, he is despised by many for forged titles, debt bondage, and deniable violence. He is one of the few in [[Redmarsh]] who know the true value of [[Wondrous Coal]].

To most, **Gauge** is a calculating autocrat who rules through paperwork, permits, and quiet threats.  
**To himself**, he is the only man willing to prepare the duchy for a war no one else believes is coming.

#### Early life and rise

Born the son of a [[Highford]] clerk, **Gauge** learned the grammar of ledgers before the grammar of prayer. Apprenticed young to a solicitor’s office, he showed a gift for the small print that turns favours into fetters. He first came to [[Redmarsh]] as an auditor after a flood year; the previous leaseholder’s death (in circumstances locals call “favourable”) opened a path. **Gauge** married the niece of the dead owner, bought up miner debts when coin was thin, and secured temporary powers from the ducal court to stabilise output. The “temporary” powers never quite ended.

#### Public persona

**Gauge** is spare and well-kept, his dark frock coat unmarked by coal dust. He speaks softly, checks his pocket-watch when crossed, and ends conversations by standing rather than raising his voice. In broadsheets and at the pithead he repeats the same two notes: **order** and **prosperity**. He calls curfews “safety hours”, checkpoints “proper accounting”, and strike-breakers “escort details”. He praises competence in enemies, offers them neat work, and documents their missteps for later.

#### Methods of control

**Gauge** governs through structures, not crowds.

- Work and gatherings require stamped **permits**.
- Lamps, explosives and tool kits are issued from the **lamp-room** and counted back.
- The causeways are gated by private watchmen who recognise **his** scrip and letters of passage.
- Over half the miners live in **company terraces**; rent and truck-shop food are docked from their pay.
- A **blacklist** in the weigh-house quietly bars agitators from any pit within reach of his influence.
- His clerk “loses” petitions that inconvenience him; his tame solicitor drafts bonds no man can escape.
- When pressure must be applied, it is done through barge-thugs and cruel foremen no magistrate can tie to his seal.

Yet beneath the cruelty lies meticulous fear — not of uprising, but of invasion.

#### Relations with court and town

**Gauge** flatters [[Prince Corvin]], feeds the court pageants with coal money, and sends neat reports whose totals always shine. With the ageing [[Duke Edrin]], he is careful—never lying outright, always wrapping decrees in talk of veterans’ stipends and safe roads. In [[Redmarsh]], he treats [[Marta Goodwin]] and the Commons’ Assembly with public civility and private smears, working to split idealists from pragmatists. He courts the [[Glasswrights’ Covenant]] for their ventilators, safe-lamps and winding engines, but only on his timetable; he admires [[Master Sola Meinh’s]] mind while quietly encouraging **Aria “Spark” Vell** to take risks that serve his quotas.

#### The coal years

Under **Gauge**, [[Redmarsh]] shifted from muddy drift-mines to a deep, dangerous labyrinth: a cage downcast, an upcast fan, longwall faces and gob fires smouldering behind. Output rose; so did funerals. He installed weigh-standards and posted safety rules where all could see them—then undercut both by pressuring foremen to meet targets regardless. He funds a small clinic and a burial fund, gestures he cites whenever the Assembly speaks of subsidence pay-outs or black lung masks. To outsiders he is the picture of a modernising steward. Locals know which doors to avoid after dark.

#### Controversies

Three documents shadow **Gauge’s** tenure:

- **The Black Book** — a weigh-house ledger of bribes, blacklisted names, and off-book payments to “escort details”.
    
- **The Deed Codicil** — a forged addendum shoring up his lease; the original charter lies, inconveniently, in a locked archive.
    
- **Payroll Irregularities** — imported “bandits” who only ever strike rival barges are, by a clerk’s neat error, paid from his discretionary account.

None of these has reached a public hearing. Not yet.

#### Support base and opposition

**Gauge’s** firmest supporters are those who depend on predictable wages: foremen rewarded for “results”, shopkeepers whose licences he renews, and newer labourers lodged in company terraces who fear eviction more than they hate him. His opposition is larger but brittle: miners’ families, river folk squeezed by checkpoints, and artisans whose tools are now “licensed”. The Assembly can swell the square; **Gauge** can shut the cage and starve wages for a week. That is usually enough.

#### Personal traits and habits

He rewrites the sentences of other people’s letters when they displease him. He collects broken scales, displayed behind his desk as a joke about “honest weights”. Coal dust never sticks to him; ink always does. He keeps a bowing civility with priests and veterans, and a curated patience with children in queue lines—until he is sure no one is looking.

#### Private fears

**Gauge** fears being seen as a brute. He can survive defeat; he cannot survive public humiliation. He dreads a day when the ledger lines fail to add up—when the Assembly finds a story that mothers believe and the [[Glasswrights’ Covenant|Glasswrights]] refuse to bless. On such a day, he would rather burn a bridge than lose face walking across it.

#### Quotations

- “The mine is a spine; break it and the body dies.”
    
- “If you had my ledgers, you would make my choices.”
    
- “We mustn’t make widows—for nothing.”

#### Legacy and prospects

If nothing changes, **Gauge** will secure a permanent charter by presenting [[Redmarsh]] as an island of order in a muddy world. If something breaks—if the **Black Book** meets the light, if the **Deed Codicil** is exposed, if a deep-mine tragedy turns the duchy’s eye—his neat structures will not save him from the crowd he has taught to queue. His name will either become a byword for “modern stewardship” in court mouths, or a curse hissed by widows when the wind turns from the coke ovens.
