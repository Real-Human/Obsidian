_Eastern Region of the [[Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing]]_

#### **Overview**

The **Fenward Marches** form the remote, marsh-bound eastern frontier of the [[Duchy of Marlowe-Helwing]]. Known for their bleak beauty, shifting waterways, and treacherous wetlands, the Marches are defined by low-lying fens broken only by scattered ridges of firmer ground where most settlements stand. Despite their isolation, the region is economically significant: its deep coal seams run beneath much of the interior, and its rivers connect to wider trade routes throughout the duchy.

The Marches hold the richest known deposits of **[[Wondrous Coal]]**, a rare and unstable mineral. Its presence is publicly regarded as an inconvenient hazard in certain seams; only a select few understand its true magical value, and this knowledge is deliberately kept from miners and the wider populace.

Though often dismissed by the ducal court as rustic, the Fenward Marches have become increasingly important in recent years, both for their industrial output and for the quiet political tensions that accompany such rapid growth.

#### **Geography**

The Marches are shaped by three major landscapes:

##### **The Fens**

Vast, mist-heavy wetlands of reeds, peat beds, and slow blackwater channels. Travel is challenging but possible along established barge routes. Floods are common in spring and autumn.

##### **Ridges and High Ground**

Narrow spines of compact earth rising only a few metres above the fen. These provide the only reliable building sites and serve as natural roads between settlements. **[[Redmarsh]]**, the largest town in the region, sits atop one of the most prominent ridges.

##### **The Eastern Wilds**

A sparsely charted expanse of marshwood, cut banks, and winding river systems. Considered dangerous and poorly monitored, it forms the natural border of the duchy.

The climate is damp and cool year-round, with sudden fogs and long, wet winters that test even the hardiest locals.

#### **Settlements**

Settlement clusters follow the ridgelines and major waterways. Notable communities include:

- **[[Redmarsh]]** – The region’s primary mining and industrial centre.
- **Kelter’s Ford** – A ferry crossing and seasonal market town.
- **Brinefell** – A fishing settlement on the fringe between fen and river.
- **Otterbarrow** – A ridge-top agricultural community known for hardy crops and livestock.
- **Low Fenmead** – A scattered hamlet of peat-cutters and reed gatherers.

Smaller outposts, watchtowers, and barge moorings dot the riverbanks throughout the Marches.

#### **Economy**

The Fenward Marches rely on three major industries:

##### **1. Coal and Peat Extraction**

Coal seams run deep beneath the ridges. Mining towns such as [[Redmarsh]] support the duchy’s industrial needs. Peat remains a traditional fuel in smaller communities.

##### **2. River Trade**

The barge routes of the Marches are vital for transporting ore, peat, grain, and timber. Despite their remoteness, these waterways keep the region connected to ducal markets.

##### **3. Marsh Agriculture and Husbandry**

Fen farms produce hardy grains, rushes, fish stocks, and waterfowl. Grazing is common on slightly elevated ground, though flooding remains a constant hazard.

#### **Governance**

The Marches fall under the authority of the **Duke of Marlowe-Helwing**, yet distance and terrain give local leaders considerable autonomy. Settlements typically rely on:

- **Town reeves**
- **Mining councils**
- **Commons’ assemblies**
- **Barge wardens**

Politics in the Marches favour pragmatism: communities cooperate when necessary, negotiate stubbornly when required, and generally prioritise survival over ceremony.

[[Redmarsh]] currently exerts the strongest regional influence due to its population, industry, and the assertive leadership of its mayoral administration.
